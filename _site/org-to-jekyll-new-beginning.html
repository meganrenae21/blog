    <p>It’s been nearly five years since I published my first blog post using org-mode. While I loved the novelty of using org-mode to create a publish a static website and blog, and I’m proud that I was able to figure out how to make it work (at least in theory), it ended up being a bit too high-maintenance for me on a practical level. My resolve to DIY my blog from the ground up ended up being its undoing.</p>

<p>So now I’m going again, this time using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll was an easy choice. I’m familiar with the platform (my knowledge database, <a href="https://megan-zk.netlify.app/">megan-zk</a>, is written with Jekyll), it’s got a wide user base and extensive documentation, and it’s flexible enough that it can be custommized to just about any purpose.</p>

<p>Mostly, though: Jekyll is easy and quick. My experience with maintaining my blog using org-mode taught me the importance of choosing a platform that allowed me to focus on the important things.</p>

<h3 id="so-was-the-org-blogging-experiment-a-failure">So, was the org blogging experiment a failure?</h3>

<p>Short answer: No.</p>

<p>Long answer: No. My org-mode blog, <a href="https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress/">Meg in Progress</a>, was a learning experiment. That was what I had intended for it to be, and to that end, it was successful.</p>

<p>And look, there’s nothing <em>wrong</em> with using org-mode as a blogging engine. <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web.html">Plenty of people have made it work for them</a>. And clearly, once I had gotten it up and running, it was working for me – at least for the <em>four</em> posts I published to Meg in Progress between August 2020 and March 2021.</p>

<p>When I decided to get back to blogging earlier this month, I wanted to use org again. The first thing I did was attempt to revamp the site as a whole, and I quickly ran into issues.</p>

<p>To start, org’s HTML export options are highly configurable, but I found it to be incredibly troublesome to manipulate the top-level HTML files so that my custom elements would be inserted exactly how and where I needed to be on the page.</p>

<p>I wanted to add a footer element to the site. This footer would appear at the bottom of each page on the site. I used the HTML export option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-html-postamble</code> to achieve this.</p>

<p>The problem was that I wanted the footer to be <em>inside</em> the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div id=content&gt;</code> which included the actual post (or page) content.</p>

<p>This is how I wanted it to look:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;
  &lt;div class="header_containter"&gt;
    &lt;div class="header"&gt;Meg in Progress&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="nav"&gt;
      &lt;a class="navlink"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a class="navlink"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a class="navlink"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a class="navlink"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="post_header"&gt;
    &lt;div class="post_title"&gt;An example title&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="post_date"&gt;XX/XX/XXXX&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="post_tags"&gt;
      &lt;a class="taglink"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a class="taglink"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="post_content"&gt;
    ...post...
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
    ...footnote section...
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    Custom footer / org postamble element
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the content container isn’t closed until after the footer is inserted, but the footer is not contained in any <em>other</em> element.</p>

<p>At first, instead of the postamble, I used a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> block to export the footer. But when I included the footer at the end of each page and post exported, it ended up like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;
... post content here...
  &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  ... some footnotes ...
    &lt;div class="footer"&gt;
      footer here
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The footer was being <em>inside</em> the last element/section of each post, rather than on its own within the top-level container.</p>

<p>I thought using the postamble export option would fix this. Instead, this was the result:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;
  ... post content here ....
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="postamble"&gt;
  footer here
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, the footer ended up <em>outside</em> the content container, which wasn’t what I wanted at all. The idea was that all the content that would appear on each page would within a parent container, in which I could use CSS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display: flex</code> to easily align and justify the elements within that box.</p>

<p>I understand that I could tinker with the export options via trial and error to figure out how to make it work. I could remove the parent container altogether, and apply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display: flex</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> element. I could use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-html-preamble</code> option to create my custom header, rather than an import statement, so both the footer and the header would be positioned <em>outside</em> the container. My issue was not that org-mode didn’t allow me to do what I wanted.</p>

<p>The issue was that the time and effort it took to get it right subtracted from the time I had available to actually write. Creating substantive content is the entire purpose of keeping a blog in the first place.</p>

<p>Another issue was that it was backwards enforcement of any the textual format of certain template elements. I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ya-snippets</code> to create templates, and once a snippet was created, the content of that snippet was not dynamic.</p>

<p>Just take a look at how the first three posts I wrote for <a href="https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress/">Meg in Progress</a> appear on the index page:</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s a mess of inconsistency. Changes made to the snippet don’t update the snippets that have already been applied. If I want to make a formatting change that will apply across <em>all</em> entries, including past entries, I would have to manually go back and change each post. Perhaps in time I could have figured out a solution, which brings me back to the previous point: it’s <em>time</em> I’m saving by moving to Jekyll.</p>

<h3 id="more-blogging-less-troubleshooting">More blogging, less troubleshooting</h3>

<p>As a developer, I’m all too familiar with the process of constantly adapting and fixing your code when it breaks or throws out results you didn’t expect. I know that, with a blog created with a static site generator, <em>some</em> technical fine-tuning will always be necessary.</p>

<p>As a blogging platform, Jekyll makes life <em>a lot</em> easier by offering several tools for the technical process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Templates and includes allow you complete control over the HTML. Everything on each page and post is laid out exactly like I set it up. I can update styles without getting unexpected results.</li>
  <li>YAML frontmatter and data files used alongside the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid templating language</a> keep pages and posts formatted consistently across the site.</li>
  <li>Extensive documentation and a huge userbase means that there are numerous resources available for any updates I want to make or any technical issues I may be having.</li>
  <li>A stockpile of available themes and plugins can help to instantly implement new features to a site.</li>
  <li>It is incredibly simple and fast to get up and running, even without a theme, and you can easily integrate your own CSS and javascript files.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/">Painless deployment</a> to the back-end platform of your choice. This blog uses <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> which builds the site each time I push a new commit to this blog’s <a href="https://github.com/meganrenae21/blog">Github repository</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that Jekyll offers every single thing I wanted right out of the box. While its builds the site from source, convering markdown (.md) files to HTML, Jekyll doesn’t create new pages from scratch. This means that I have to create monthly archive pages and tag pages myself whenever I create the first post in a particular month or use a tag for the first time. What I <em>don’t</em> need to do, though, is update those pages each time I make a new post. Archive lists are created programmatically through the liquid templates. Every post with the tag “jekyll” will show up in the tag page for <a href="./tags/jekyll.html">jekyll</a>, provided the page exists. Every post from June 2025 will show up in the corresponding <a href="./archives/2025/june.html">June 2025 archive page</a> – again, provided the page exists. The markdown source for these tag and archive pages is completely empty except for two lines of YAML frontmatter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: 
layout: 
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <em>layout</em> is the file in the source <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> folder that serves as the HTML template for the page, and the <em>title</em> is used to pull all posts with that tag or from that month.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging">plugin</a> for a simpler implementation of tags. I could also write a script in Python that would generate pages for me. I may do this in the future. However, it’s hardly any trouble to manually add a new page with the required frontmatter whenever I need to–and that way I don’t have to worry about any additional scripts or plugins breaking. It keeps things light-weight.</p>

<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>

<p>I plan to keep contributing to this blog, and making changes as I go along. I don’t really have any major plans for the blog itself for the time being. I had considered adding a comment system, but I don’t have the readership for that right now.</p>

<p>I see this site as a way to share information about various projects I’m working on and the things I’m learning. I want to focus primarily on publishing good, substantive content worth reading.</p>
