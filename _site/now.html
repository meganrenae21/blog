<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Currently reading: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23395680-illuminae">Illuminae</a> by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff.
    <ul>
      <li>I put this one off for a while. A few years ago I decided I wanted to start reading less YA and more adult fiction, especially when it comes stories with a big emphasis on romance. Still, the format of this book was intriguing, so I’ve finally started.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Just finished: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201930181-the-mercy-of-gods">The Mercy of Gods</a> by James S.A. Corey
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t like starting on-going series before all the books have been published, but <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/56399-the-expanse">The Expanse</a> is one of my all-time favorites and I couldn’t wait to read the next epic story Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (the duo behind the penname) would create together. So now I’m stuck waiting until the next one comes out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On deck: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings">The Way of Kings</a> by Brandon Sanderson.
    <ul>
      <li>Technically, this one also breaks the <em>don’t start incomplete series</em> rule, but since the first four books are out, and they are <em>looooong</em>, I figured this was pretty risk-free. I’m not usually super into fantasy, but I’ve enjoyed Sanderson in the past.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recently threw on the DNF pile: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a> by Yuval Noah Harari.
    <ul>
      <li>This one <em>really</em> disappointed me. I’d been wanting to read this for years, and it just drastically fell short. The author continually made big claims without adequate (or any) citations, often skewed facts to suit the narrative he was trying to create, and I just generally felt the writing style to be overbearing and condescending.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<p>I have a plan to study as much as I can about machine learning and AI. I started this a few years ago, but then life got in the way, so I’m giving it another go.</p>

<p>Right now, this is what I’m working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science">Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization</a> at Coursera, from DeepLearning.AI.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/">Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</a> path from Google’s Tech Dev Guide.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projects-im-working-on">Projects I’m Working On</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Over on codepen, I have a project to finish 15 <a href="https://codepen.io/megan-durham/pen/QwbVNLY">Pure CSS Background Patterns</a></li>
  <li>I am working on an UI that will help me playing my favorite solo RPG, <em>Ironsworn: Starforged</em> by Shawn Tomkin. <a href="https://codepen.io/megan-durham/pen/QwbqLXW">Sneak peak at Codepen</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interesting-and-thought-provoking-things">Interesting and Thought-Provoking Things</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I recently discovered <a href="https://tarotcardsoftech.artefactgroup.com/">The Tarot Cards of Tech</a>, an elegantly designed set of tarot cards with questions designed to enable people to think about how to build and develop technologies responsibly. These cards were created by <a href="https://www.artefactgroup.com/">The Artefact Group</a>, a consulting and design firm focusing on implementing new technologies responsibly. In the age of AI, the ethical implications of tech and data are reaching into every facet of our lives. These cards are tools to help us consider the consequences of our progress,  in order to direct our world toward positive change and growth.
    <ul>
      <li>I love the design of these cards. They ask personal, open-ended questions that have you explore your own values and morals and determine how they align with your work. They help you identify potential pitfalls and dangers that will cause harm, and encourage you to consider how you can do the most good.</li>
    </ul>
