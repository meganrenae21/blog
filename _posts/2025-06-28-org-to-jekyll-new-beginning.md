It's been nearly five years since I published my first blog post using org-mode. While I loved the novelty of using org-mode to create a publish a static website and blog, and I'm proud that I was able to figure out how to make it work (at least in theory), it ended up being a bit too high-maintenance for me on a practical level. My resolve to DIY my blog from the ground up ended up being its undoing. 

So now I'm going again, this time using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll was an easy choice. I'm familiar with the platform (my knowledge database, [megan-zk](https://megan-zk.netlify.app/), is written with Jekyll), it's got a wide user base and extensive documentation, and it's flexible enough that it can be custommized to just about any purpose. 

Mostly, though: Jekyll is easy and quick. My experience with maintaining my blog using org-mode taught me the importance of choosing a platform that allowed me to focus on the important things. 

### So, was the org blogging experiment a failure?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: No. My org-mode blog, [Meg in Progress](https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress/), was a learning experiment. That was what I had intended for it to be, and to that end, it was successful. 

And look, there's nothing *wrong* with using org-mode as a blogging engine. [Plenty of people have made it work for them](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web.html). And clearly, once I had gotten it up and running, it was working for me -- at least for the *four* posts I published to Meg in Progress between August 2020 and March 2021. 

When I decided to get back to blogging earlier this month, I wanted to use org again. The first thing I did was attempt to revamp the site as a whole, and I quickly ran into issues. 

To start, org's HTML export options are highly configurable, but I found it to be incredibly troublesome to manipulate the top-level HTML files so that my custom elements would be inserted exactly how and where I needed to be on the page. 

I wanted to add a footer element to the site. This footer would appear at the bottom of each page on the site. I used the HTML export option `org-html-postamble` to achieve this. 

The problem was that I wanted the footer to be *inside* the main `<div id=content>` which included the actual post (or page) content.

This is how I wanted it to look:

```
<div id="content">
  <div class="header_containter">
    <div class="header">Meg in Progress</div>
    <div class="nav">
      <a class="navlink">about</a>
      <a class="navlink">archives</a>
      <a class="navlink">tags</a>
      <a class="navlink">home</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="post_header">
    <div class="post_title">An example title</div>
    <div class="post_date">XX/XX/XXXX</div>
    <div class="post_tags">
      <a class="taglink">tag</a>
      <a class="taglink">another</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="post_content">
    ...post...
  </div>
  <div class="footnotes">
    ...footnote section...
  </div>
  <div class="footer">
    Custom footer / org postamble element
  </div>
</div>
```

Notice how the content container isn't closed until after the footer is inserted, but the footer is not contained in any *other* element. 

At first, instead of the postamble, I used a custom `include` block to export the footer. But when I included the footer at the end of each page and post exported, it ended up like this:

```
<div id="content">
... post content here...
  <div class="footnotes">
  ... some footnotes ...
    <div class="footer">
      footer here
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The footer was being *inside* the last element/section of each post, rather than on its own within the top-level container. 

I thought using the postamble export option would fix this. Instead, this was the result:

```
<div id="content">
  ... post content here ....
</div>
<div class="postamble">
  footer here
</div>
```

This time, the footer ended up *outside* the content container, which wasn't what I wanted at all. The idea was that all the content that would appear on each page would within a parent container, in which I could use CSS `display: flex` to easily align and justify the elements within that box. 

I understand that I could tinker with the export options via trial and error to figure out how to make it work. I could remove the parent container altogether, and apply `display: flex` to the `<body>` element. I could use the `org-html-preamble` option to create my custom header, rather than an import statement, so both the footer and the header would be positioned *outside* the container. My issue was not that org-mode didn't allow me to do what I wanted. 

The issue was that the time and effort it took to get it right subtracted from the time I had available to actually write. Creating substantive content is the entire purpose of keeping a blog in the first place. 

Another issue was that it was backwards enforcement of any the textual format of certain template elements. I used `ya-snippets` to create templates, and once a snippet was created, the content of that snippet was not dynamic. 

Just take a look at how the first three posts I wrote for [Meg in Progress](https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress/) appear on the index page:

> #### What the Latest Impreachment Trial Says about the Current State of US Politics

And since that post has been published, I've made a few more changes to the configuration and so, in an effort to provide the most up to date information, I figured I'd write a little addendum. <span class="fake_link">Read more…</span>

As you can see, it's a mess of inconsistency. Changes made to the snippet don't update the snippets that have already been applied. If I want to make a formatting change that will apply across *all* entries, including past entries, I would have to manually go back and change each post. Perhaps in time I could have figured out a solution, which brings me back to the previous point: it's *time* I'm saving by moving to Jekyll.

### More blogging, less troubleshooting

As a developer, I'm all too familiar with the process of constantly adapting and fixing your code when it breaks or throws out results you didn't expect. I know that, with a blog created with a static site generator, *some* technical fine-tuning will always be necessary. 

As a blogging platform, Jekyll makes life *a lot* easier by offering several tools for the technical process:

- Templates and includes allow you complete control over the HTML. Everything on each page and post is laid out exactly like I set it up. I can update styles without getting unexpected results. 
- YAML frontmatter and data files used alongside the [Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) keep pages and posts formatted consistently across the site. 
- Extensive documentation and a huge userbase means that there are numerous resources available for any updates I want to make or any technical issues I may be having. 
- A stockpile of available themes and plugins can help to instantly implement new features to a site.
- It is incredibly simple and fast to get up and running, even without a theme, and you can easily integrate your own CSS and javascript files. 
- [Painless deployment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/) to the back-end platform of your choice. This blog uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which builds the site each time I push a new commit to this blog's [Github repository](https://github.com/meganrenae21/blog). 

This is not to say that Jekyll offers every single thing I wanted right out of the box. While its builds the site from source, convering markdown (.md) files to HTML, Jekyll doesn't create new pages from scratch. This means that I have to create monthly archive pages and tag pages myself whenever I create the first post in a particular month or use a tag for the first time. What I *don't* need to do, though, is update those pages each time I make a new post. Archive lists are created programmatically through the liquid templates. Every post with the tag "jekyll" will show up in the tag page for [jekyll](./tags/jekyll.html), provided the page exists. Every post from June 2025 will show up in the corresponding [June 2025 archive page](./archives/2025/june.html) -- again, provided the page exists. The markdown source for these tag and archive pages is completely empty except for two lines of YAML frontmatter:

```
---
title: 
layout: 
---
```

The *layout* is the file in the source `_layouts` folder that serves as the HTML template for the page, and the *title* is used to pull all posts with that tag or from that month. 

There is a [plugin](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging) for a simpler implementation of tags. I could also write a script in Python that would generate pages for me. I may do this in the future. However, it's hardly any trouble to manually add a new page with the required frontmatter whenever I need to--and that way I don't have to worry about any additional scripts or plugins breaking. It keeps things light-weight.

### What next?

I plan to keep contributing to this blog, and making changes as I go along. I don't really have any major plans for the blog itself for the time being. I had considered adding a comment system, but I don't have the readership for that right now. 

I see this site as a way to share information about various projects I'm working on and the things I'm learning. I want to focus primarily on publishing good, substantive content worth reading.
